# Naive implementation of Event sourcing in F#

This repository is place to experiment with event sourcing and the F# stack.

It currently uses Giraffe for the "rest" API and plain F# for the Eventstore communication. This project is mainly used as a personal learning tool.
Mainly to get more familiar with programming F# and what it is like to work with events/CQRS instead of an N-tier architecture.
